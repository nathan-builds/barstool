# barstool
Thanks for checking out this project! The idea was to expand on the simple bosxcore widget by using more of the data available from the JSON feed. 
This widget contains the live scores and game status, highlighted players depending on the sport, and different player stats below the main scores. It was 
constructed in a generic way to enable the support of more sports in the future. The steps to run this project are below!

Steps to run:

1. From inside boxscore-backend run the following commands from a terminal
  - `npm i`
  - `npm start`
2. From inside boxscore run the following commands from a terminal:
  - `npm i`
  - `npm run dev`
